# Food22 Classification Dashboard

Welcome to the Food22 Classification Dashboard repository! This project features a web-based dashboard for image classification, showcasing a deep learning model trained to classify food images. The dashboard allows users to upload their images for classification, view class distributions, and examine the model's performance metrics.

## Features

- **Image Classification**: Upload an image and get predictions from the trained model.
- **Dataset Visualization**: View class distributions and dataset size.
- **Model Performance**: Examine the confusion matrix and other performance metrics.
- **Image Update**: Refresh the dataset image displayed on the dashboard.
